/**
 * Remembers what a {@link ResourceContentsReader} answered, so that a resource is read at most
 * once for as long as this cache lives.
 * 
 * <p>A cache is meant to live as long as one run, e.g. one validation of a document or of a
 * directory tree: whoever runs creates it when the run starts and drops it when the run ends. That
 * is why it has neither a bound nor a way to clear it, and why a file changed while a run reads it
 * is seen by that run as it was first read. Reading without a cache is done by asking a reader
 * directly.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The reader decides who answers with the contents of a resource: the resource itself, unless
 * the cache is given a reader knowing better, e.g. one answering with the text an editor holds and
 * did not save yet.</p>
 * 
 * <p>What was read is remembered under the resource's {@link Resource#getResolvedPath() resolved
 * path}, which is what tells two resources apart for whoever resolved them. A resource without such
 * a path, and an {@link UnresolvedResource}, whose path is only the target as it was written, are
 * read every time they are asked for: nothing tells them apart from another resource of the same
 * name.</p>
 * 
 * <p>A failure of reading is remembered just as long as the contents would have been, so a resource
 * that cannot be read is not read again for the next one asking, and every one of them is told what
 * went wrong. Several threads may ask at the same time; a resource they ask for at once is read by
 * the first of them, while the others wait for what it read.</p>
