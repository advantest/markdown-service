/**
 * Remembers the documents parsed from Markdown resources, so that a resource is parsed at most once
 * for as long as this cache lives.
 * 
 * <p>A cache is meant to live as long as one run, e.g. one validation of a document or of a
 * directory tree: whoever runs creates it when the run starts and drops it when the run ends. That
 * is why it has neither a bound nor a way to clear it. A parsed document can be changed by whoever
 * holds it, and even rendering it writes into it, so the documents of a cache are meant for the run
 * owning it and are not to be read by two threads at the same time.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The text is read through the {@link ResourceContentsCache} this cache is given, so a resource
 * whose contents a run read first and parses later is read once. A parsed document carries the
 * resource it was read from, so that what it refers to resolves against its own location.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Only a resource named like a Markdown file is parsed, i.e. one carrying an extension the parser
 * accepts as Markdown. Reading anything else and parsing it as Markdown would answer about a
 * document that never existed, so asking for it is a programming error.</p>
 * 
 * <p>A document is remembered under the resource's {@link Resource#getResolvedPath() resolved
 * path}. An {@link UnresolvedResource}, whose path is only the target as it was written, is read
 * and parsed every time it is asked for. A failure is remembered just as long as the document would
 * have been, and several threads may ask at the same time; a resource they ask for at once is parsed
 * by the first of them, while the others wait for what it parsed.</p>
